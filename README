Media Manager
===
The purpose of a common Media Manager API is to provide to IVI
applications a way to control basic playback of contents of connected
CE devices. A single API enables a wider range of available devices
and media without implementing separate solutions for each type of
device.

Media Manager is composed of 3 main areas:
- Media Control Play Pause etc. including feedback for status play time etc.
- Media Indexer incuding Metadata discovery
- Media Browser Directory and Metadata Browsing - Artist album etc.
